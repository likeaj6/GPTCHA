# GPTCHA - Winner of "AI for Good" Hackathon üéâüèÜ

We are excited, grateful, and deeply honored to share GPTCHA, the winner of the ["AI for Good" Hackathon](https://partiful.com/e/9ft7v8NYnFin5BL3p9Ar)! This project represents a new era of Captcha 2.0, specifically designed to combat malicious uses of generative AI and mitigate the impact of robocalls.

The conception, development, and achievement of GPTCHA couldn't have been possible without the outstanding collaboration between our team members, [@nearlydaniel](twitter.com/nearlydaniel), [@nicolas_ouporov](twitter.com/nicolas_ouporov), and [@jasonljin](twitter.com/jasonljin). Our journey to this achievement started with an invitation from [@edchucation](twitter.com/edchucation) to the hackathon, bringing us together to brainstorm, develop and deploy our solution. A special shout-out to [Atmosphere House](http://atmosphere.house) where three of our team members reside!

## üí° The Idea 

Inspired by the promise and peril of AI, we devised GPTCHA to counteract the increasingly sophisticated robo-calls and scams. These malicious activities account for 60% of all calls, contributing to an estimated $180 billion dollar losses due to fraud in the US alone.

The idea was to leverage the power of AI for good, to devise a system capable of detecting and preventing these threats. This resulted in GPTCHA, a tool that embodies an adversarial dialogue between two AI agents, aimed to automate the process of distinguishing between robocalls and genuine human calls.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

GPTCHA is a two-tier system, each powered by GPT-4. One agent is oriented towards protecting your information, while the other is programmed to attempt phishing your information. Through this adversarial interplay, GPTCHA is able to discern AI-generated responses with an impressive degree of accuracy.

But it doesn't stop there. Our system also utilizes semantic search, vector-based search, and text embeddings to fact-check and verify information, adding another layer of security against potential threats. Moreover, it employs custom voice models via @elevenlabsio and Whisper for speech recognition and synthesis. It even supports cloned voices - we've trained an AI to mimic a human voice, bringing more realism to the interaction.

## üôè Our Appreciation

Winning the "AI for Good" Hackathon has been an exhilarating and humbling experience. We are immensely grateful to @internetactivism, @cerebralvalley, and @openai for hosting this wonderful event. Our victory is a testament to the great potential AI holds when used responsibly and creatively for the betterment of society.

We also wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners and sponsors @huggingface, @pinecone, @weaviate, @pearvc, @instacart, and @AnthropicAI. Their support played a pivotal role in our success.

A special thank you goes out to @AviSchiffmann and the rest of the @internetactvsm team for putting together the incredible "AI for Good" Hackathon!

## üåê The Future

We are thrilled about the good this technology can do when deployed at scale and are excited to share our future developments. GPTCHA represents a promising step towards a safer, more secure communication space.
